## Objectives:
	- The goal of this project is to study the relationship between orbital positions and time using a neural network for polynomial regression. The dataset consists of time steps and their corresponding orbital positions, and a neural network implemented using Keras is used to predict the orbital positions based on time steps.


## Dataset:
	- X : time_steps.
	- Y : y.


## Dependencies:
The following Python libraries are required to run this project:

	- numpy: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
	- pandas: To load and preprocess the dataset.
	- matplotlib: For data visualization (e.g., plotting the results).
	- scikit-learn: For data preprocessing (e.g., normalization, splitting datasets) and performance evaluation.
	- tensorflow (Keras): To build and train the neural network model.
All dependencies are already available on Google Colab by default.


## Steps to run the code:
1- Clone the GitHub repository:
	-click in the code button in the repository.
	-select Download ZIP.
	-Un-ZIP the folder.

2- Open Google Colab:
	- go to google colab.
	- in the top-left corner, click File > Upload NoteBook.
	- choose the (Keras.ipynb) file from the local machine.

3- Upload the dataset:
	- upload the dataset (orbit.csv) file to the Colab environment.
	- To upload the file, click on the folder icon in the left-hand pane of Google Colab.
	- Drag and drop your (orbit.csv) file into the file explorer (file in the downloaded folder from GitHub).

4- Run all cells:
	- After uploading the dataset, go to the Runtime menu at the top of the Colab page.
	- Select Run all to execute all cells in the notebook.
